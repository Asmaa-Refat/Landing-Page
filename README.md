# Project Description
This project is an interactive landing page project consists of some HTML and CSS as starter code and JS which i added.

## JS Code Description
First of all, I created two global variables; one to store the empty unordered list that i have in the HTML page which soon will be populated with list items, and the other variable is for storing all the sections i have.

Then I created a for loop to loop over all the sections using the global variable i firstly created and created a list item for each section. after the for loop finishes, i added all the list items to the unordered list using the fragment to improve the performance and reduce the number of reflows that could have possibly happened.

After that i created a inViewPort function that checks if a specific section is in the viewport or not.

Lastly, i created a sectionActivation function to add the 'your-active-class' class to the active section and removes it from the rest of the sections.
